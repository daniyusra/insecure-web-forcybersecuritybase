What is the project? 
- School Report Card Viewer
-> Two types of users: Teacher/Admin and Student

- Teacher can input/edit scores and add/delete students
- Students can browse lesson scores


Vulnerability:
1. SQL injection: (A03 2021) Students or even teachers can use SQL injection
- Solution: SQL sanitization  
2. Broken Access Control: (A01 2021) Students can access endpoint for inputting/editing scores
- Solution: Add authorization check before processing score input requests
3. Insecure Design: (A04 2021) A credential recovery workflow including  "questions and answers"
- Solution: Suggest other methods for credential recovery such as email or directly contact teachers
4. Identification and Authentication Failure: (A07 2021) Allows weak password on change password screen
- Solution: Verify password before password change
5. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:(A09 2021) There is no logger for input/editing or even browsing of scores
- Solution: Add logger, especially in input/editing
